System call wrapper library functions are functions provided by the operating system or external libraries 
that encapsulate low-level system calls and provide a higher-level, more convenient interface for programmers. 
These wrapper functions often handle errors, simplify parameter passing, and provide additional functionality 
compared to the raw system calls. Using these wrappers can make system programming easier and more portable. 

Below are some examples of commonly used system call wrapper library functions in C/C++:

1. Standard C Library Functions:
    fopen() and fclose(): Wrappers for opening and closing files, providing a higher-level file I/O interface.
    fread() and fwrite(): Wrappers for reading and writing data to files, abstracting away the raw read() and write() system calls.
    malloc() and free(): Wrappers for memory allocation and deallocation, making it easier to manage dynamic memory.

2. Standard Input/Output Library Functions:
    printf() and scanf(): Wrappers for formatted output and input, making it easier to display and read data from the console.
    getchar() and putchar(): Wrappers for reading and writing individual characters from/to the console.


3. Networking Library Functions:
    socket(): A wrapper for creating a socket for network communication, simplifying the process of setting up network connections.
    bind() and connect(): Wrappers for binding a socket to an address and connecting to a remote address in a network application.


4. Thread Management Library Functions:
    pthread_create(): A wrapper for creating threads, encapsulating the low-level thread creation system call.
    pthread_join(): A wrapper for joining threads, abstracting away the details of thread synchronization.


5. File System Library Functions:
    mkdir() and rmdir(): Wrappers for creating and removing directories, providing a convenient way to manage file system directories.
    opendir(), readdir(), and closedir(): Wrappers for working with directories, simplifying directory traversal.


6. Error Handling Library Functions:
    perror(): A wrapper for printing an error message based on the current value of errno, providing more descriptive error messages.
    strerror(): A wrapper for converting an error number to a human-readable error message.


7. Time and Date Library Functions:
    time(): A wrapper for obtaining the current time in seconds since the epoch.
    ctime(): A wrapper for converting a time value to a human-readable string representation.


These are just a few examples of system call wrapper library functions commonly used in C/C++ programming. 
Many programming environments, operating systems, and libraries provide additional wrapper functions to make 
system programming easier and more portable across different platforms. When available, it's often beneficial 
to use these higher-level wrappers instead of making raw system calls directly to improve code readability, maintainability, and portability.
